"(In this section we want to see something like "
"https://github.com/takemiyamakoto/hyperledgerwp/tree/master/RelevantUseCases"

"people can be inspired to use Iroha and can also use their imagination to"
" come up with interesting application. This can be expanded later with "
"good suggestions on hackatons and real-life examples in such use cases.)"
