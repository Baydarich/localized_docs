## How to contribute?

First of all, *do not contribute to this repository directly*, please. We are using a project in poeditior.com service, and so far we need reviewers for the languages, which don't have any (check the table below).

As you translate strings, please ping a reviwever in your language using IM like Rocket.Chat or telegram or simply tell us about it in our Rocket.Chat #iroha chatroom. Your help is highly appreciated by us and local communities of developers.

If there is no reviwer — please talk to us in Rocket.Chat so that we can build a community with you.

## Current issues

1. Update of localized strings is done manually, there is no CI which triggers for update of documentation. In the future, we should use https://github.com/sporteasy/python-poeditor for a better automated pipeline, so that we don't need to import new terms manually or export them (the interface of website is awful).
2. Scripts are stored next to translation, since I was not able to specify target folder in `sphinx-intl`. 

### How to update .po files in documentation manually 

#### Prerequisites

- [sphinx-intl](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-intl/)
- gettext
- sphinx-build or sphinx

#### Steps

1. Update submodule — it should point at the latest commit in the repository: `git submodule update --init --recursive; git submodule update --remote --merge` 
2. In folder `translation` run `generate_symlinks.py` in case that symbolic links pointing at .rst files are different from what is in root `/docs` language folder of this repository.
3. In folder `translation` run `make gettext`, which puts all English strings into .pot files in `/locale`.
4. After it, run `make translate` which converts .pot files to .po files targeted at a specific language (these files are in sync with POEditor project).
5. Commit all the changes in repository and push them.
6. Update strings in POEditor.com. In the future, it should be done with a git hook.
