msgid "``max_proposal_size`` is the maximum amount of transactions that can be in one proposal, and as a result in a single block as well. So, by changing this value you define the size of potential block. For a starter you can stick to ``10``. However, we recommend to increase this number if you have a lot of transactions per second."

#: ../iroha/docs/source/guides/configuration.rst:43
msgid "``proposal_delay`` is a maximum waiting time in milliseconds before emitting a new proposal. Proposal is emitted if the ``max_proposal_size`` is reached or ``proposal_delay`` milliseconds had passed. You can start with ``5000`` and increase this number if you have a lot of transactions per second since it is likely that with an intense load (over 100 transactions per second) and low value of ``proposal_delay`` there will be many proposals of small size."

msgid "``vote_delay`` is a waiting time in milliseconds before sending vote to the next peer. Optimal value depends heavily on the amount of Iroha peers in the network (higher amount of nodes requires longer ``vote_delay``). We recommend to start with 100-1000 milliseconds."
msgstr ""

#: ../iroha/docs/source/guides/configuration.rst:54
msgid "``load_delay`` is a waiting time in milliseconds before loading committed block from next peer. We recommend setting this number the same value as ``proposal_delay`` or even higher."
