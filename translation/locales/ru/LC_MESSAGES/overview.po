"Hyperledger Iroha is a general purpose permissioned blockchain system "
"that can be used to manage digital assets, identity, and serialized data."
" This can be useful for applications such as interbank settlement, "
"central bank digital currencies, payment systems, national IDs, and "
"logistics, among others."

"Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to be permissionless ledgers where "
"anyone can join and access all the data. They also have native "
"cryptocurrencies that are required to interact with the systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../iroha/docs/source/overview.rst:33
msgid ""
"In Iroha, there is no native cryptocurrency. Instead, to meet the needs "
"of enterprises, system interaction is permissioned, meaning that only "
"people with requisite access can interact with the system. Additionally, "
"queries are also permissioned, such that access to all the data can be "
"controlled."
msgstr ""

#: ../iroha/docs/source/overview.rst:36
msgid ""
"One major difference from Ethereum, in particular, is that Hyperledger "
"Iroha allows users to perform common functions, such as creating and "
"transferring digital assets, by using prebuilt commands that are in the "
"system. This negates the need to write cumbersome and hard to test smart "
"contracts, enabling developers to complete simple tasks faster and with "
"less risk."

"How is it different from the rest of Hyperledger frameworks or other "

msgid ""
"Iroha has a novel, Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm (called "
"YAC [#f1]_) that is high-performance and allows for finality of "
"transactions with low latency. Other frameworks either focus more on "
"probabilistic consensus algorithms, such as Nakamoto Consensus, or "
"sacrifice Byzantine fault tolerance."
msgstr ""

#: ../iroha/docs/source/overview.rst:45
msgid ""
"Also, Iroha's built-in commands are a major benefit compared to other "
"platforms, since it is very simple to do common tasks such as create "
"digital assets, register accounts, and transfer assets between accounts. "
"Moreover, it narrows the attack vector, improving overall security of the"
" system, as there are less things to fail."
msgstr ""

"Finally, Iroha is the only ledger that has a robust permission system, "
"allowing permissions to be set for all commands, queries, and joining of "
"the network."

"In order to bring the power of blockchain into your application, you "

" exactly is a transaction and query, and how users of your application "
"are supposed to interact with it."

"We also have several client libraries which provide tools for developers "
"to form building blocks, such as signatures, commands, send messages to "
"Iroha peers and check the status."
