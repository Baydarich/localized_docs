"``max_proposal_size`` is the maximum amount of transactions that can be "
"in one proposal, and as a result in a single block as well. So, by "
"changing this value you define the size of potential block. For a starter"
" you can stick to ``10``. However, we recommend to increase this number "
"if you have a lot of transactions per second."

"``proposal_delay`` is a maximum waiting time in milliseconds before "
"emitting a new proposal. Proposal is emitted if the ``max_proposal_size``"
" is reached or ``proposal_delay`` milliseconds had passed. You can start "
"with ``5000`` and increase this number if you have a lot of transactions "
"per second since it is likely that with an intense load (over 100 "
"transactions per second) and low value of ``proposal_delay`` there will "
"be many proposals of small size."

"``vote_delay`` is a waiting time in milliseconds before sending vote to "

"``patterns`` controls the formatting of each log string for different "
